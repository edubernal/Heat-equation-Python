# Heat-equation-Python

This code code allows you to solve the heat equation for an unidimensional bar with constants boundary values and calculate both the local production of entropy and the total entropy
In the folder numeric there is all the code needed to solve it numerically in python plus the folder analytic allow you to plot the analytic solution in order to compare the solutions.
